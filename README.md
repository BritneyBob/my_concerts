# Repo for basic python programming assignment 
Central repo for an assignment in the course 'Grundläggande programmering i Python', 
which is the first part of the 2-year program 'Pythonutvecklare med inriktning AI' at 
Teknikhögskolan in Gothenburg.

The app My Concerts helps me to remember all the concerts I've been to. I can save concerts I have 
been to with the name of the artist, venue and location, date of the concert, and optionally people 
I went with and a note about the concert. I can also search for concerts that I've already saved.
